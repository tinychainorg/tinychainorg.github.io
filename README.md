# Welcome to tinychain

Want to experiment with new blockchain designs? Sick and tired of the 2000 page War And Peace -style docs to get setup with OP Stack? 

Introducing **tinychain**.

Tinychain is an ultra-lightweight blockchain core, written in Python.

In under 1000 LOC:
- cryptography
- transactions
- consensus - Nakamoto POW, Tendermint PoS
- VM's - Lisp, Brainfuck, EVM
- state machine
- gas markets
- protocol, RPC, and P2P networking

Let the devs do what they do best - building cool stuff.

## Built on Tinychain

**Brainnet**. A blockchain that runs Brainfuck. [https://tinychainorg.github.io/brainnet/](https://tinychainorg.github.io/brainnet/)


## What else can I do with Tinychain?

 * Create your own proof-of-work blockchain network, in ~1min.
 * Experiment with new **data availability** tech:
   * Celestia.
   * Google Sheets.
 * Experiment with new **consensus** modules:
   * Nakamoto
   * Tendermint
   * Narwhal/Bullshark
 * Experiment with new **gas/payment mechanisms**
   * SaaS-style pricing for transactions - $x/month!
   * Free transactions for hodlers of NFT's
   * Points
 * Experiment with new **VM designs**:
   * A network that only verifies ZK proofs.
   * Brainfuck
   * RISC V
   * GPU / [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)
 * Experiment with other random stuff:
   * [zero-knowledge shuffle protocols](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/curdleproofs.pie/)
