      In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin with the genesis hash "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of
      second bailout for banks".
    </p>
    <p>
      What you might not know was this was not the first genesis block. An early prerelease version of the bitcoin
      source code, distributed on the metzdowd cryptography mailing list, contained an <b>alternative genesis block
        mined in 2008</b>, on the date the Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy (credit: <a
        href="https://serhack.me/articles/story-behind-alternative-genesis-block-bitcoin/">SerHack</a>).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>

    <!-- Would the real genesis please stand up. -->
    <pre style="font-size: 12px; text-align:center;">
<b style=""><i><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nakamotoinstitute/code/bitcoin-nov08.tgz">bitcoin-nov08.tgz</a> / bitcoin.cpp:39</i></b>

    <p>
      tinychain is a chain building upon Satoshi's alternative genesis block. We are building a modern, cleanroom
      implementation of a Nakamoto blockchain, that automatically compresses its history in realtime using ZK proofs,
      and allows anyone in the world to sync the chain in only 10s.
    </p>



    <br />
    <h1>Philosophy.</h1>
    <p><b>Our goal:</b> to give everyone on the planet a cryptographically-sovereign bank account.</p>
    <p><b>How?</b> By building a Nakamoto chain where syncing your node takes only 10s.</p>
    <p>We believe this is not only possible, it is the only way forward. There are 8.1B people in the world. If each
      person
      had a bitcoin account denoted by <code class="inline">(pubkey [32]byte, balance uint64)</code> pair, the total
      state
      size would be 40 B * 8100000000 B = 324 GB.</p>
    <p>With ZK proofs, we can ensure anyone can run a node with zero reliance on external centralizer infrastructure
      (e.g.
      indexers). A tinychain node downloads the latest block headers (~5MB, 1 proof) and verifies the proof which
      demonstrates this is
      the longest chain (~10s). Then to query balances, they download the latest balance (40 bytes) for an account from
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a>, and verify it belongs
      to the
      current state root using a Merkle proof (32 * 32B = 1KB).</p>
    <p>The total cost to access the network and sync your account for anyone in the world? A 56kB/s internet connection,
      1MB
      of storage, and a CPU that existed in the early 2000's.</p>
    <h2>Why proof-of-work?</h2>
    <p>A simple question is - why proof-of-work? Proof-of-work consensus is the ultimate in liveness mechanisms for
      blockchains. Proof-of-stake, although effective, is still not as simple and robust as proof-of-work.
      Using just two nodes and an internet connection, POW can run a full financial system that will outlast the
      bureaucratic machinery of any one nation state fiat.</p>
    <!-- <h2>Why a new network?</h2>
    <p>Using everything we have learnt about blockchains in 15 years, is it possible to design something better? We believe the answer is yes.</p> -->

    <br />

    <h1>Design.</h1>
    <p>
      tinychain augments the core Nakamoto primitives with ZK-friendly ones:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hashcash</b>: SHA256 -> <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf">Poseidon</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Signatures</b>: ECDSA signatures -> ZK signatures which show knowledge of a hash's preimage.</li>
      <li><b>Blockchain history</b>: blocks processed into state -> succinct state snapshots with ZK-SNARK proofs of
        validity.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In doing so, we make it possible to efficiently prove the validity of blocks, and thus the history of nakamoto
      state, <strong><i>in realtime</i></strong>.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to mining the POW solution, miners generate a proof of their block before disseminating it.</li>
      <li>Each proof shows the validity of the POW solution, the signatures of all transactions, and the new accounts
        state. Proofs verify the proof of the previous block using recursive verification.</li>
      <li>Using the <a href="https://blog.lambdaclass.com/groth16/">groth16</a> ZK-SNARK proving scheme, with the BN256
        curve, and Poseidon hash function, we can create proofs of size 32B (3 field elements of 8 bytes each).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>With this design, we can ensure that the entire history of the chain is compressed into a series of proofs, which
      can be verified in realtime by any node in the network.</p>
    <p>Consequently, it becomes possible to securely bridge $TNY to other blockchain networks such as Ethereum because of ZK proofs. We believe enshrining the ZK proofing as part of Tinychain, rather than relying on external dependencies such as <a href="https://docs.gevulot.com/gevulot-docs/network/overview">prover networks</a>, is the right decision for the long-term sovereignity of the chain.</p>

    <br />
    <h1>Distribution.</h1>
    <p>Tinychain is designed to fulfill Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin as global P2P <a href="https://polynya.mirror.xyz/Gbd0BKCDM9mG9wqZg9Hd1wLwwS3sbfUi31ZK786YQRU">alt-sovereign hard money</a>. As such, 99% of
      the Tinychain supply will be distributed permissionlessly through mining.</p>
    <p>The Tinychain token, $TNY, will be distributed fairly to every person with a computer in the entire world, as
      Satoshi desired.</p>
    <p>To prevent centralization of mining power (ASIC's and FPGA's) which skews the distribution of the $TNY reward,
      Tinychain will reuse the <a href="https://xilinx.github.io/blockchainacceleration/kernel_design.html">Ethash POW
        kernel</a> pioneered by Ethereum, adapted for ZK proofing.</p>
    <p>The supply curve and monetary issuance will mirror that of Bitcoin.</p>

    <br />

    <h1>Our fundraise.</h1>
    <p>We are hosting an uncapped IDO raise of $5M for 1% of the $TNY supply (and only that). Buyers will have their
      tokens generated at launch with 4YR linear unlock (matching the release of the first 1% of block rewards). We are looking for investors who believe in the vision of a world where everyone has a
      crypto bank account, and are willing to support us in building it.</p>

    <br />

    <h1>Who is behind this?</h1>
    <p>My name is Liam (<a href="https://github.com/liamzebedee/">@liamzebedee</a>) and I've been in crypto for over 10
      years. I've been interested in P2P systems since I was 14, publishing <a
        href="https://www.mail-archive.com/p2p-hackers@lists.zooko.com/msg03411.html">whitepapers to the p2p-hackers
        mailing list</a> and so on, and most recently inventing a product for decentralized frontends known as <a
        href="https://www.theblock.co/post/175483/crypto-dev-creates-way-to-access-prohibited-apps-like-tornado-cash">Dappnet</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I believe with ZK proofs we have a real opportunity to build "Bitcoin 2.0", that is 1,000x faster to access,
      while retaining the same robustness and security of POW. Moreso, I believe it is our responsibility to Satoshi to
      fulfill his vision - global, P2P money that is distributed fairly.</p>
    <p>And emphasis on <i><b>fairly</b></i>. Tinychain will not be a VC-centralized project. We will be selling 1% of
      the total supply in a fair raise and that's it.</p>
    <p>It's time we get back to our roots. Stay humble, mine tiny.</p>
